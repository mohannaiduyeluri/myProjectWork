# Hello,
- Hello professor, my name is Mohan Sandeep Yeluri I am a graduate student enrolled for Fall-2021 semester. I have used computer for the first time to draw circuit diagrams using PSpice software in Electronics Devices and Circuits lab during my under-graduation course. I also used to write some basic programs in C, Java during my 1st year of under-grad. I took courses like OOPS through Java, C and Data Structures, C++ as a part of under-grad academic curriculum. Also took programming and data structures using Java in 1st semester of my graduation. I have done some electronic projects using Arduino & Beagle bone black microprocessor boards and wrote the code in the C language in Linux environment. I have also used Windows, Linux, IOS operating systems. 
- After completion of the course, I see myself as a full stack developer working in a reputed company. I would like to learn how to implement an application from scratch which includes frontend and backend. The softwareâ€™s that are being thought in this course like NodeJS & Vue, GraphQL, MongoDB are of high demand in the market learning them as a part of course curriculum will surely help me advance quickly.
